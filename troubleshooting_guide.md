This is a document that can be used to track down and fix errors and bugs within the full perfect 
fit system.

###  There is no synced data from the sensor data collector
To check whether sensor data is coming in, the number of steps on this day can be checked by
typing `doel` to the coach. The printed number is the amount of steps recorded today. So if a number
is printed, you are sure that it has been connected today. The SenSeeAct apps should give a
notification on the phone: 'Measurement is active'

#### Troubleshooting - Problems with bluetooth connection
Make sure there is a bluetooth connection between the phone and watch. Garmin Connect app on the phone should display
a green circle at the top of the screen. Also, if you hold the `LIGHT` button on the watch, it will
display a green ðŸ“ž icon, meaning that the watch is connected to a phone. 

If there is no connection, the following steps could be tried:
1. Make sure the bluetooth on the phone is ON.
2. Make sure bluetooth is ON, on the watch:
   1. Hold the `LIGHT` button
   2. Navigate to the ðŸ“ž icon.
   3. Press `START` and make sure there is no diagonal line through the ðŸ“ž icon.
3. The watch can get into 'Energy saving mode', disabling bluetooth. To disable energy save mode:
   1. Hold the `LIGHT` button
   2. Navigate to the ðŸ“ž icon.
   3. Press `START` and make sure there is no diagonal line through the ðŸ“ž icon.
